Don't Forget the HTACCESS File
==============================

The GitHub repo contains a .htaccess file that works for perl-p4g3s. Don't
forget to add this on your server or the routing won't work:

    Options +FollowSymLinks

    RewriteEngine on

    RewriteBase /

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d 

    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.pl?q=$1 [L,QSA]

You may also need to configure your directory to serve Perl scripts (you'll 
know this if the script is being served as plain text). Setting up Apache is
outside of the scope of these documents, but assuming Apache is configured to
allow overrides of ExecCGI you may only need to add this:

    Options +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl

CGI is pretty slow but fine for a low-traffic site. I haven't tried to set up
**perl-p4g3s** with FastCGI or PSGI, please let me know if you test this out.

Perl-P4g3s From A Subdirectory
--------------------------------

If you want to put your site somewhere other than the root directory (perhaps
a subdirectory like blog/) there are a couple of additional steps:

Change the `RewriteBase` to the subdirectory where index.pl lives.

    RewriteBase /blog/

You'll also need to change a configuration variable. Look for this:

    "site.uri"          => "/"

And change it to:

    "site.uri"          => "/blog" # or wherever your subdirectory is
