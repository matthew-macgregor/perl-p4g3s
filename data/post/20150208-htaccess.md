Don't Forget the HTACCESS File
==============================

The GitHub repo contains a .htaccess file that works for perl-p4g3s. Don't
forget to add this on your server or the routing won't work:

    Options +FollowSymLinks

    RewriteEngine on

    RewriteBase /

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.pl?q=$1 [L,QSA]
