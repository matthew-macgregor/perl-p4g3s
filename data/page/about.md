**perl-p4g3s** (Perl-Pages) is a micro-framework for blogging. The goals of the project are
intensely simple: create a useful blog framework with just a single, small file  of perl and
the Markdown library. More specifically:

* No admin pages (FTP, baby!)
* Pure markdown to post
* Fast execution
* Simple maintenance
* Static html caching
* lulz

I hacked this together in a couple of hours one Saturday, but it's powered my blog for a
long time. It's perfect for people who want a simple blog fast, and want to avoid all of
the overhead of a larger framework or (gasp!) Wordpress.

Of course, if you need features, **perl-p4g3s** isn't for you. It's simple, quirky and fast,
and it's never going to have XYZ feature. For a simple blog, it's a lot of fun.

While I don't plan to spend much time building features or maintaining **perl-p4g3s**,
I do have a wishlist:

* Add replacement variables.
* Metadata summaries to show on the home page.
